# 1. LIMITS

/* 1. Try using LIMIT yourself below by writing a query that displays all the data in the occurred_at, account_id, and channel columns of the web_events
table, and limits the output to only the first 15 rows. */

SELECT occurred_at, account_id, channel
FROM web_events
LIMIT 15;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. ORDER BY 

-- 1. Write a query to return the 10 earliest orders in the orders table. Include the id, occurred_at, and total_amt_usd.

SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Write a query to return the top 5 orders in terms of the largest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. Write a query to return the lowest 20 orders in terms of the smallest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd
LIMIT 20;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. ORDER BY II

/* 1. Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted first by the account ID  (in ascending order), and then by 
the total dollar amount (in descending order). */

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id, total_amt_usd DESC;

/* 2. Now write a query that again displays order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in descending 
order), and then by account ID (in ascending order). */

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC, account_id;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. WHERE

-- 1. Pull the first 5 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a dollar amount of gloss_amt_usd greater than or equal to 1000.

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_amt_usd >= 1000
LIMIT 5;

-- Pull the first 10 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a total_amt_usd less than 500.

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amt_usd < 500
LIMIT 10;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. WHERE with Non-Numeric Data

-- Filter the accounts table to include the company name, website, and the primary point of contact (primary_poc) just for the Exxon Mobil company in the accounts table. 

SELECT name, website, primary_poc
FROM accounts
WHERE name = 'Exxon Mobil'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Arithmetic Operations

/* 1. Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 
10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields. */

SELECT id, account_id, ROUND(standard_amt_usd/standard_qty, 3) AS std_unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;


/* 2. Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue that comes from poster paper for each order. You will need to use only the columns that end with _usd. 
(Try to do this without using the total column.) Display the id and account_id fields also. 

NOTE - you will receive an error with the correct solution to this question. This occurs because at least one of the values in the data creates a division by zero 
in your formula. There are ways to better handle this. For now, you can just limit your calculations to the first 10 orders, as we did in question #1, 
and you'll avoid that set of data that causes the problem.*/

SELECT id, account_id, 
ROUND(poster_amt_usd/(standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd + poster_amt_usd), 3) * 100 AS poster_rev_percentage
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;
